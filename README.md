# RGB_Arduino_and_bt_project

RGB led control

In this project the led can be control using Bluetooth. 


we need hc_05, Arduino, rbg led. 
The code provide several modes,
It has different color scheme (mode). 


we can set different solid color by giving command through phone via Bluetooth from 'a' to 'z',
and Different modes like fade, smooth cycle and so on... by giving command from 1 to 9.


To off the led give command 'A'. 


If u want to add more led or want to connect the led strip, the power won't be sufficient ,so by use transistor we can supply from 5v to rated transistor voltage up to 24v.
